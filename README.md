# SquareDifference
The first line takes in the number of test cases T. The following lines take in the test cases one by one, let us take one of them to be N. Then comes the output, the output gives 2 whole numbers in a single line separated by a space., such that the difference of the two numbers is equal to N. If no such 2 numbers exist, -1 is to be printed. Each line of the output corresponds to each line input. My problem is that the time complexity of the program is too much, arising due to the triple nested FOR loop. The goal is to remove the triple nested FOR loop and apply an alternate logic that gives the same output with less time complexity, and less complexity in general.
